# Resonance-Capture-of-Planets
A repository of codes and data of PH4203 Term Paper

All the codes, data and plots required/used in the making of the term paper are attached here.

## Extensions of this work
Take a look at the following repositories and papers that follow from there
1. https://github.com/shadden/celmech.git
2. https://github.com/smirik/resonances.git
3. https://github.com/LucaMalavolta/PyORBIT.git
4. https://github.com/gracefulmacdonald/exoMMR.git
5. https://github.com/hannorein/rebound.git (Used in this project to simulate planetary systems and also used by all the packages above. This repository works as a fundamental repository to all things gravity)

One very creative work is done here, which uses this planetary resonance to predict a possible planet's orbital parameters based on the resonances missing in a system. This could be extended to the latest exoplanet dataset to find new planets. The link of the paper: https://www.semanticscholar.org/reader/694abfedef02ae64a5f67a7dfb674ea2ede08296.
